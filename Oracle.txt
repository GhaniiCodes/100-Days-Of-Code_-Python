Description

The Oracle GROUP BY clause is used in a SELECT statement to collect data across multiple records and group the results by one or more columns.

Syntax

The syntax for the GROUP BY clause in Oracle/PLSQL is:

SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n, 
       aggregate_function (aggregate_expression)
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions]
GROUP BY expression1, expression2, ... expression_n;
Parameters or Arguments

expression1, expression2, ... expression_n
The expressions that are not encapsulated within an aggregate function and must be included in the GROUP BY clause.

aggregate_function
It can be a function such as SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, or AVG functions.

aggregate_expression
This is the column or expression that the aggregate_function will be used on.

tables
The tables that you wish to retrieve records from. There must be at least one table listed in the FROM clause.
WHERE conditions

Optional. The conditions that must be met for the records to be selected.

Example - Using SUM function

Let's look at an Oracle GROUP BY query example that uses the SUM function.

This Oracle GROUP BY example uses the SUM function to return the name(title) of the job and the total sales (for that job title).

select job,sum(sal),min(sal),max(sal),avg(sal),count(*) 
from emp 
group by job;

JOB         SUM(SAL)   MIN(SAL)   MAX(SAL)   AVG(SAL)   COUNT(*)
--------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
CLERK           4150        800       1300     1037.5          4
SALESMAN        5600       1250       1600       1400          4
PRESIDENT       5000       5000       5000       5000          1
MANAGER         8275       2450       2975 2758.33333          3
ANALYST         6000       3000       3000       3000          2

Because you have listed one column (the job field) in your SELECT statement that is not encapsulated in the aggregate function, you must use the GROUP BY clause. The job field must, therefore, be listed in the GROUP BY clause.

Example - Using COUNT function

Let's look at how we could use the GROUP BY clause with the COUNT function.

This GROUP BY example uses the COUNT function to return the job category and the number of employees (in that category) that have over 2000 salary.

SELECT job, COUNT(*) AS "Number of Employees"
FROM suppliers
WHERE sal > 2000
GROUP BY job;

JOB       Number of Employees
--------- -------------------
PRESIDENT                   1
MANAGER                     3
ANALYST                     2

Example - Using MIN function

Let's next look at how we could use the GROUP BY clause with the MIN function.

This GROUP BY example uses the MIN function to return the number of each department and the minimum salary in the department.

SELECT deptno, MIN(sal) AS "Lowest salary"
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno;

 DEPTNO Lowest salary
---------- -------------
        30           950
        20           800
        10          1300


Example - Using MAX function

Finally, let's look at how we could use the GROUP BY clause with the MAX function.

This GROUP BY example uses the MAX function to return the number of each department and the maximum salary in the department.

SELECT deptno, Max(sal) AS "Highest salary"
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno;


DEPTNO Highest salary
---------- --------------
        30           2850
        20           3000
        10           5000


Description

The Oracle/PLSQL COUNT function returns the count of an expression.

Syntax

The syntax for the COUNT function in Oracle/PLSQL is:

SELECT COUNT(aggregate_expression)
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions];

OR the syntax for the COUNT function when grouping the results by one or more columns is:

SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n,
       COUNT(aggregate_expression)
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions]
GROUP BY expression1, expression2, ... expression_n;

Parameters or Arguments

expression1, expression2, ... expression_n are expressions that are not encapsulated within the COUNT function and must be included in the GROUP BY clause at the end of the SQL statement.

aggregate_expression
This is the column or expression whose non-null values will be counted.
tables
The tables that you wish to retrieve records from. There must be at least one table listed in the FROM clause.
WHERE conditions
Optional. These are conditions that must be met for the records to be selected.
Only includes NOT NULL Values

Not everyone realizes this, but the COUNT function will only include the records in the count where the value of expression in COUNT(expression) is NOT NULL. 
When expression contains a NULL value, it is not included in the COUNT calculations.

Let's look at a COUNT function example that demonstrates how NULL values are evaluated by the COUNT function.




SQL> select count(empno) from emp;

COUNT(EMPNO)
------------
          14


This COUNT example will return 14 since all values of empno in the query's result set are NOT NULL.

However, if you ran the next SELECT statement that uses the COUNT function:
SQL> select count(comm) from emp;

COUNT(COMM)
-----------
          4

This COUNT example will only return 4, since only one comm values in the query's result set is NOT NULL. 

Applies To

Example - With Single Field



For example, you might wish to know how many employees have a salary above $2,000 / year.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number of employees"
FROM emp
WHERE sal > 3000;

In this COUNT function example, we've aliased the COUNT(*) expression as "Number of employees". As a result, "Number of employees" will display as the field name when the result set is returned.

Example - Using DISTINCT

You can use the DISTINCT clause within the COUNT function. For example, the SQL statement below returns the number of unique departments where at least one employee makes over $55,000 / year.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT deptno) AS "Unique departments"
FROM emp
WHERE sal > 1500;

select count(job) from emp;

COUNT(JOB)
----------
        14

select count(distinct job) from emp
SQL> /

COUNT(DISTINCTJOB)
------------------
                 5

Example - Using GROUP BY

In some cases, you will be required to use the GROUP BY clause with the COUNT function.


For example, you could also use the COUNT function to return the number of the department and the number of employees (in the associated department) that are clerks.


select deptno, count(job) as 'clerks' from emp where job='CLERK' group by deptno;

    DEPTNO COUNT(JOB)
---------- ----------
        30          1
        20          2
        10          1

select deptno, count(job) from emp where job='MANAGER' and sal>1500  group by deptno;


    DEPTNO COUNT(JOB)
---------- ----------
        30          1
        20          1
        10          1

Because you have listed one column in your SELECT statement that is not encapsulated in the COUNT function, you must use a GROUP BY clause. The department field must, therefore, be listed in the GROUP BY section.
